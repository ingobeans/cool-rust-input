an input crate for fine control over each key press and rendering of text. by default allows multiline input, but custom behaviour can be added to make enter submit.

**only seems to properly work on windows.** on my linux machine the arrow keys aren't properly recognised.

## todo:
* markdown support (to some degree)
* pgdown/pgup
* fix linux support
