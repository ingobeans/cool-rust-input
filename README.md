an input crate for fine control over each key press and rendering of text. by default allows multiline input, but custom behaviour can be added to make enter submit.

cross platform, tested on windows 11, arch and termux.

## todo:

- markdown support (to some degree)
- pgdown/pgup
- fix linux support
- ctrl left/right arrow
- fix delete key not being able to delete newline
